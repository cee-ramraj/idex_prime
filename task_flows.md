# Image Manupilations
1. Image seggregation and integration as single EO and single IR image.
2. Image stitching - to obtain single image over the entire horizon.
3. Image enhancement - to improve chances of Detection, Recognition, Identification, and Tracking of objects
4. Kalman filter - to be used in tracking of objects.

# Object Detection Flow
1. Image is available as a single image from all EO cameras and a single image from all IR cameras.
2.
